# fauxCRT
A web-based fake terminal that acts as some old DOS or UNIX OS. Users can run fake commands, and maybe even visual programs. UI made to resemble a CRT monitor from the 80s. I hope you consider voting for Summer of Making! :)

please run ths in a smaller window. it will lag lots if you dont, and it will feel a little less realistic
